<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 25px; color: #ff0000;"><strong>What are the special features of the Progressive Web Apps extension for Magento 2?</strong></span></p>

<div class="row col2-set">
<div class="col-md-6 col-1"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Quickly Add To Homescreen </strong></span></span>
  
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Once the shoppers visit your store for the first time on their mobile, they will be prompted to add a shortcut to their home screen instantly to access your Magento Progressive Web App. After that, they will have a chance to experience <em>the app-like look</em> and <em>full-screen mode</em> – without the distraction of the URL bar. Compared to persuading them to install a native app, it would be much easier to earn a place on the buyers’ home screen, right?
</span>
  
<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Engaging Push Notifications</strong></span></span>
  
<span style="font-weight: normal;">With this amazing feature, you can engage and draw customers’ attention even when their browser is closed. You can easily notify your buyers of your promotional campaigns, introduce your latest products and simply remind them to visit your store after a long time. In the future, this might be a better way to approach the customers than traditional email marketing since people are likely to click on a push notification than open an email.
</span>
  
<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Easy Updates</strong></span></span>
  
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Similar to the usual web pages, the Magento Progressive Web App can be updated at ease once the page is refreshed.</span></span></div>
  
<div class="col-md-6 col-2"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Lightning Load Speed</strong></span></span>
  
<span style="font-weight: normal;">More than 50% of visitors will leave if your mobile version takes more than 3 seconds to load. With <strong>Progressive Web App for Magento 2</strong>, the page is loaded nearly instantly – in milliseconds, not seconds. Therefore, your customers will not see the flash of the white screen when navigating between pages, and the page header will persist throughout the transition.
</span>
  
<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Convenient Offline Mode</strong></span></span>
  
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">This is impossible for both webs and apps but not for the Magento PWA. Under poor or non-existent connectivity, the customers can still continue browsing in your Magento store as long as they have visited your pages. As a result, they can enjoy the seamless shopping experience in your store – anywhere they go – even in uncertain network areas like elevators or subways.
</span></span>
  
<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Searchable By Search Engines </strong></span></span>
  
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Since the <strong>Magento 2 Progressive Web App</strong> has the same structure as the websites, they can be optimized, searchable by search engines, and shared via URLs as well.</span></span></span></span></div>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 25px; color: #ff0000;">Why is Progressive Web App necessary for your Magento store?</span></h2>

There are 3 persuasive reasons that explain why building a <strong>Magento </strong><strong>Progressive Web App</strong> is a must for your Magento e-commerce store:
<h3><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Firstly, the number of mobile users is rocketing but either the mobile web or the native apps have many limitations.</strong></span></span></h3>

In spite of being responsive and optimized for mobile, the mobile web cannot prove its capability to drive conversion rates. In contrast, the native app seems to be more effective but it asks you to invest a significant amount of time, money, and effort to build an app. Additionally, most customers are hesitant to download an app just to make their one-time purchases.

Luckily, the <strong>Magento Progressive Web App</strong> can help you to solve all of these headache problems:
<ul class="features-listing">
 	<li>You don’t need to have an ample budget to acquire an app (free download at our store).</li>
 	<li>It takes just a few seconds to install.</li>
 	<li>It allows the customers to access the web app with just one click.</li>
 	<li>It provides an amazing app-like experience to boost your conversions.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Secondly, the Progressive Web Apps can help you to stay ahead of the competition.</strong></span></span></h3>

Currently, there are not many e-commerce stores knowing tremendous benefits from the Magento Progressive Web App or are not be able to build it. Therefore, let’s grasp this chance to become one of the first Magento stores to take advantage of this technology and stand out in your niche market.
<h3><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> Thirdly, with Progressive Web App for Magento, you will see exponential growth in sales.</strong></span></span></h3>

By blending the best features of the web apps and the mobile applications, the Magento PWA will bring about an awesome experience for the customers, and stimulate their purchases. <em><strong>Alibaba, AliExpress, Flipkart</strong>, </em>and <em><strong>Lancome</strong></em> are large e-commerce businesses that have adopted the Progressive Web App technology and gained significant success.
